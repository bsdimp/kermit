#
# WARNING: This is a pre-Beta test release.  Use at your own risk.
#
# WARNING #2: This is a huge makefile, and it contains nested makes.
# Some make programs run out of memory.  If this happens to you (as it will,
# for example, for 2.xBSD on PDP-11s), edit away all the parts that do not 
# apply to your system and try again.
#
#   C-Kermit can also be built for many other systems not supported by
#   this makefile, including the Apple Macintosh, the Commodore Amiga,
#   OS-9, IBM OS/2, DEC VAX/VMS.  See the ckaaaa.hlp file for information.
#   Support was also added to C-Kermit for some other systems like Data
#   General AOS/VS and Apollo Aegis, but the system-dependent modules for
#   these versions need a lot of work to bring them up to 5A level.
#
# INSTALLATION NOTES:
#
# Rename this file to "makefile" or "Makefile" if necessary.  Pick out the
# make entry most appropriate for your UNIX system from the list below and
# then give the appropriate "make" command, for example "make bsd", "make
# sys5r3", "make posix".  For more detailed installation instructions,
# read the file ckuins.doc.  For descriptions of known problems and
# limitations, read the file ckuker.bwr (the "beware file").
#
# Some of the implementations listed below are untested for v5A:
# + Marks those that have been tested successfully.
# - Marks those that are known not to work.
# ? Marks those yet untested.
#
# Those marked with + are not guaranteed to work.  The "+" means that C-Kermit
# 5A was built successfully and tested to some degree without showing obvious
# problems, but not necessarily in the current edit.  That is, something that
# has been done to the program in recent edits might have broken a previously
# working version.
#
# Please report failures (preferably with fixes) or successes to the author.

#
# To remove intermediate and object files, "make clean".
# To run lint on the source files, "make lintsun", "make lintbsd",
# "make lints5", as appropriate.

#
# NOTES FOR V7 AND 2.X BSD (BASED ON VERSION 4E OF C-KERMIT):
#
# For Unix Version 7, several variables must be defined to the values
# associated with your system.  BOOTNAME=/edition7 is the kernel image on
# okstate's Perkin-Elmer 3230.  Others will probably be /unix.  PROCNAME=proc
# is the name of the structure assigned to each process on okstate's system.
# This may be "_proc" or some other variation.  See <sys/proc.h> for more
# info on your systems name conventions.  NPROCNAME=nproc is the name of a
# kernel variable that tells how many "proc" structures there are.  Again
# this may be different on your system, but nproc will probably be somewhere.
# The variable NPTYPE is the type of the nproc variable -- int, short, etc.
# which can probably be gleaned from <sys/param.h>.  The definition of DIRECT
# is a little more complicated.  If nlist() returns, for "proc" only, the
# address of the array, then you should define DIRECT as it is below.  If
# however, nlist() returns the address of a pointer to the array, then you
# should give DIRECT a null definition (DIRECT= ).  The extern declaration in
# <sys/proc.h> should clarify this for you.  If it is "extern struct proc
# *proc", then you should NOT define DIRECT.  If it is "extern struct proc
# proc[]", then you should probably define DIRECT as it is below.  See
# ckuv7.hlp for further information.
#
# For 2.9 BSD, the makefile may use pcc rather than cc for compiles; that's
# what the CC and CC2 definitions are for (the current version of the
# makefile uses cc for both; this was tested in version 4E of C-Kermit and
# worked OK on the DEC Pro 380, but all bets are off for version 5A).  2.9
# support basically follows the 4.1 path.  Some 2.9 systems use "dir.h" for
# the directory header file, others will need to change this to "ndir.h".
# There are also newer entries for 2.10 BSD, which need testing and probably
# refinement, particularly a new entry that builds the program with overlays
# for DEC PDP-11s.
#
# The v7 and 2.9bsd versions assume I&D space on a PDP-11.  When building
# C-Kermit for v7 on a PDP-11, you should probably add the -i option to the
# link flags.  Without I&D space, overlays will be necessary (if available),
# or code segment mapping (a`la Pro/Venix if that's available).

# Entries to make C-Kermit for specific systems.
#
# Put the ones that need short makefiles first (read instructions for
# BSD 2.10 for hints...)

#Berkeley UNIX 2.10 and 2.11 on the DEC PDP-11.
#
#2.10BSD and 2.11BSD (the latter to a larger extent) are the same as 4.3BSD
#but without a large address space.  The BSD29 define should *not* be used.
#This entry doesn't work because "make" runs out of memory on the PDP-11,
#because of the size of this makefile.  A separate makefile, ckubs2.mak, is
#provided, which should be identical with this makefile, but with all the
#parts stripped away that are not relevant to this entry.  Use it like this:
#
#  mv ckubs2.mak makefile     -- or --     make -f ckubs2.mak bsd210
#  make bsd210
#
#If you don't have the ckubs2.mak file, edit this makefile to remove 
#everything below this entry.  Here's an easy way:
#
#  grep -n ^.BSD210END makefile    (notice the line number)
#  head -x makefile > ckubs2.mak   (use the same line number in place of x)
#  mv ckubs2.mak makefile
#  make bsd210
#
#NOTE: A string extraction method is used to put approx. 9kb of strings into
#a file. The module ckustr.c should be edited, if necessary, to change the
#pathname of the string file to where this file will reside (or just define
#the environment variable KSTR to be the pathname for the string file before
#running "make"), e.g. "setenv KSTR `pwd`kermit5.sr".  After make is finished,
#the file kermit5.sr should be moved to the where ckustr.c has been told to
#look for it.
