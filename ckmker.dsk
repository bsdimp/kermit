MACINTOSH KERMIT DISTRIBUTION

This is the Columbia University Macintosh Kermit distribution diskette.
It contains several sets of files:

Kermit Programs (double click to run the desired program):

  CKMKER - The Macintosh Kermit program
  CKMKEY - The Macintosh Kermit keyboard configurator

Settings Files (double click to start up Kermit with saved settings, or
edit settings with CKMKER or CKMKEY):

  Normal Settings - Normal Mac Kermit startup file
  IBM Mainframe Settings - Sample startup file to use with IBM systems

Utilities:

  Set File - Allows examination and changing of file attributes;
    particularly useful with binary resource files downloaded by Kermit.

  Bin Hex - Converts Macintosh applications to "hex" files and vice versa;
    useful for transporting Mac applications on "foreign" media.

  Disk Utility - Useful for duplicating the Macintosh Kermit distribution
    (or any other) diskette, especially on 2-drive systems.

Documentation (in plain text format, read with Mockwrite desk accessory).

  each small enough to fit into Mockwrite on a 128K Mac.

  The Beware File lists known bugs and limitations.

  The Update History lists changes that have been made since previous releases.

  The System folder contains the Finder V 4.1, and the Mockwrite desk
